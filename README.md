## Game description

Two type of enemies, the default one will move right and left and deal damage, the follower will do the same but will follow you if it's see you. Thos two enemies can drop healing capsule.
Two traps, the peaks, deal one damage point, and the laser with different frequencies, deal 2 damage point.

Platform move between two point, so you have to wait sometimes and don't go under it, it will change direction and you will miss it.
To kill the boss you need to turn the cannon toward the boss to do so you have to active two pad at the same time, so use the crates, and to shoot press the third pad (on the lonely platform)
The boss has some health oint so you need to shoot the laser a long time, be careful, avoid its attack.
